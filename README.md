# General Notes on Setup and Design

Hereâ€˜s the basic process of developing and deploying an app with docker:

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose on the Raspberry Pi

    See SETUP.md.

2. Set up a registry at Docker Hub

    Docker hub is the github of docker images. I have account with doodles67 as the user name. 

3. Initiate a Docker build of the app to create the Docker Image.

    See DOCKER-REFERENCE.md

4. Deploy the image to the Raspberry Pi

    Se DOCKER-REFERENCE.md

5. Add the image to the docker-compose service on the Raspberry Pi.

    See DOCKER-COMPOSE-SERVICE.md
